# Personal_Stats_Package
This is a opinionated statistics package using numpy, scipy, and matplotlib. I hope to start replacing functionality from these packages with personal implementations of them over time. This will be used to evaluate and deepen understanding of various statistical models and theories. 


# TODO
* Allow for Categorical Variables
* Implement additional statistical tests
* Implement regression / unit testing
* Add csv reading/parsing functionality
* Better format the repository so that it can more easily be expanded
* Need to create method to find critical values for the various tests
