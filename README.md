# Personal_Stats_Package
This is a opinionated statistics package using numpy, scipy, and matplotlib. I hope to start replacing functionality from these packages with personal implementations of them over time. This will be used to evaluate and deepen understanding of various statistical models and theories. 


* TODO
  ** Allow for Categorical Variables
  ** Implement additional tests
  ** Add csv reading/parsing functionality
  ** Better format the repository so that it can more easily be expanded
