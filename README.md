# Personal_Stats_Package
This is a opinionated statistics package using numpy, scipy, and matplotlib. I hope to start replacing functionality from these packages with personal implementations of them over time. This will be used to evaluate and deepen understanding of various statistical models and theories. 

# Install
This package requires python 3.5+, numpy, and matplotlib. 
To download the requirements for this project you can use pip with the following command.
* pip install -r requirements.txt

# Test and run
With the packages installed and python 3.5 all that should need to be done is type python runner.py. This file is a brief showing of some of the functionality currently avaible in the project. This will be expanded in the future to be a cli with help function support and dynamic data loading.
# TODO
* Allow for Categorical Variables
* Implement additional statistical tests
* Implement regression / unit testing
* Add csv reading/parsing functionality
* Better format the repository so that it can more easily be expanded
* Need to create method to find critical values for the various tests
